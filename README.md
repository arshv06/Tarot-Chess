Tarot Chess P2P

Tarot Chess is a strategic, high-stakes variation of classic Chess. By combining traditional piece movement with an advanced "Tarot" card system, players can manipulate the board in ways standard chess never allowed. Built with a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, it offers a seamless, serverless multiplayer experience.

Players earn Tarot Cards by capturing any non-pawn piece (Knight, Bishop, Rook, or Queen). You can hold up to 5 cards at a time.

Available Cards:

Time Warp (+30s): Adds 30 seconds to your clock.
Glacial Freeze: Target a specific enemy piece to freeze it in place for 3 turns.
Mind Wipe: Burn a random card from your opponent's hand.
Quantum Leap (Teleport): Select one of your pieces and move it to any empty square on the board, bypassing all movement rules.
Demotion: Instantly transforms the opponent's Queen into a Pawn.
Necromancy (Revive): Resurrects your captured Queen on any available square on your back rank.
Vertigo (Board Flip): Disorient your opponent by flipping their perspective of the board for 10 seconds.
